# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — Streaming, fuzzy matching, Gemini, inspection, CI & pre-commit

**New capabilities**
- **Streaming (SSE) support** — the recorder now passes streaming responses
  through to your agent in real time while capturing the full content and
  token usage for the cassette. The replayer serves recorded streams back as
  OpenAI-compatible `text/event-stream`, so streaming agents replay offline.
- **Fuzzy matching** — `traceplay replay --fuzzy [--fuzzy-threshold 0..1]`.
  When the exact request hash misses, the replayer falls back to
  message-similarity matching, tolerating small wording changes while keeping
  exact matching (deterministic) as the default.
- **Gemini provider** — normalization for `:generateContent` /
  `:streamGenerateContent` endpoints (contents + systemInstruction →
  messages, usageMetadata → tokens).
- **`traceplay inspect <cassette.jsonl>`** — pretty-print a cassette: event
  timeline, token usage, tool calls, errors. Great for debugging recordings.
- **GitHub Action** — `action.yml` composite action (`traceplay/action`) for
  one-line CI integration.
- **pre-commit hook** — `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` + `traceplay init --pre-commit`
  generates `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

**v0.1.0 recap**
- Record / replay / test CLI (VCR + pytest for AI agents)
- 9 assertion types (tools, answers, budgets), 3 reporters, JSONL cassettes
- Agent Skills adapter (SKILL.md → mock agent → cassette → suite)
- 39 unit/integration tests
